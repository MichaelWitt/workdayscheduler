_Workday Scheduler._


Hello! My name is Mike. I am a dreamer, designer, and developer. Welcome to the Workday Scheduler!

<!-- In this mission I created a code quiz that tests a users knowledge of JavaScript. I started this one from scratch, by writing the html that contained the frame for the quiz, creating the css, which stylized the website and formatted it with a beautiful and accessible layout, and finished by adding javascript, which brought the quiz to life; adding a timer, questions, answers, and more! I hope that you enjoy seeing the fruits of my labors, in the Code Quiz.   -->

Thanks for stopping in! I look forward to working together to make the present and future a better place.
