A smart and simple calendar app that lets you save events to better schedule your day! 

_Workday Scheduler._


Hello! My name is Mike. I am a developer, designer, and dreamer. Welcome to the Workday Scheduler!

If you are looking for a reliable and inquisitive space to write down your daily todo's and better plan your workday, then this is the site for you! The workday scheduler was created using the Moment.js API, along with JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML. The HTML houses the framework of the site, the CSS is used to make the site look more appealing, and the JavaScript and jQuery were used to change the function and form of the site. The time blocks and buttons were created in html, the time blocks change color by adding a css class to the appropriate elements, onclick events and local storage were added in jQuery to make sure that your information is entered and saved, and if statements and a for loop assists in changing the color of containers depending on the time of day. I hope that you enjoy the functionality and simplicity of the workday scheduler. 

Thanks for stopping in! I look forward to working together to make the present and future a better place.
